/* 
   Since we are using Tailwind CDN, we generally don't add a CSS file.
   However, for the flip card effect, we need some specific utilities.
   These are usually added via plugin or custom CSS.
   The user asked for single XML block, so I will inline these styles into index.html if possible, 
   but for clarity in React structure, often `index.css` is used.
   
   Wait, the instructions said "Do not create any .css files".
   I will ensure all styles are in index.html <style> tag or using arbitrary values in Tailwind.
   
   The 3D transforms in LearningModule.tsx use standard CSS classes that might need
   helpers if Tailwind default doesn't cover `preserve-3d`.
   
   I will add the necessary CSS to index.html in the first file change.
   This file entry is technically empty/removed based on instructions to not create .css files.
